            <p class="writings">I'm now persuing my B.Sc degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering(ETE) from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology(RUET), a very reknowned public university in Bangladesh. My school and college was Bogura Cantonment Public School & College. I studied there for a long 14years! Besides studing I love singing, photography and read story books. I want to go abroad for higher studies. Because of that now I'm working on my skill sets and academics very seriously and hoping for the best. A struggling human being living in this competitive world and competing with the belief that, One day I'll live my dream and die with pride!</p>
